# 🌈 Colour Flipper Project - Recap 💖
**What I Practiced:**  Dynamically changing webpage background colours with JavaScript! ✨
** Key Concepts Reinforced:**
*  💻 ** DOM Manipulation:** 💻 Accessing and modifying the `document.body` to directly affect the webpage's appearance.
*  ☎️ ** Function Calls:**  ☎️ Creating and triggering JavaScript functions using HTML buttons to execute specific colour changes.
*  🌈 ** Random Colour Generation:** 🌈 Implementing a random colour generator using `Math.random()` and `Math.round()` to create a dynamic and visually engaging experience.
**In essence:** A fun exercise in connecting user interaction (button clicks) to dynamic visual changes on a webpage, solidifying my understanding of JavaScript's core capabilities.
