#  Colour Flipper Project - Recap 🌈
**What I Practiced:**  Dynamically changing webpage background colours with JavaScript! ✨
** Key Concepts Reinforced:**
*  💻 ** DOM Manipulation:** 💻 Accessing and modifying the `document.body` to directly affect the webpage's appearance.
*  ☎️ ** Function Calls:**  ☎️ Creating and triggering JavaScript functions using HTML buttons to execute specific colour changes.
*  🌈 ** Random Colour Generation:** 🌈 Implementing a random colour generator using `Math.random()` and `Math.round()` to create a dynamic and visually engaging experience.
**In essence:** A fun exercise in connecting user interaction (button clicks) to dynamic visual changes on a webpage, solidifying my understanding of JavaScript's core capabilities.

# Palindrome Checker Project - Recap ✅
 **What I Practiced:** Learned how to take user input, manipulate strings (reverse them), and make decisions with `if` and `else` statements to a Palindrome Checker. 
 ** Key Concepts Reinforced:**
 **Getting the Input 📝:**
* Grabbed the text typed into the input box by the user. This is the starting point for the check!
**Reversing the Text 🔄:**
* UReverse the text:
**Split:** Turned the text into an array of individual letters. ✂️
**Reverse:** Reversed the order of the letters in the array. 🔙
**Join:** Put the reversed letters back together into a single reversed string. 🧵
**The Check!**
Created a function to compare the original text with the reversed text. Is it a palindrome?
Used `if` and `else` to display a message based on whether it's a palindrome or not. 🎉
**Clean Up 🧹:**
Cleared the input box so the user can try again with a new word.

# ✨ Quote Generator Project - Recap 

**1.   Setting Up and Storing the Quotes:** 📝
    *    Created a JavaScript array (`const quotes = [...]`) to store the quotes!
    *    Used `document.getElementById("quote")` to get the quote display area from my HTML.

**2. 💡 Generating Quotes & Making it Clickable!:**
    *    Made a function called `generateQuote()` that picks a random quote from my list!
    *    Used `quoteElement.innerHTML = quote;` to show the quote on the page.
    *   Made the button trigger the `generateQuote()` function with `onclick="generateQuote()"`. 

**3. 🚫 Making Sure Quotes Don't Repeat:**
    *    Used a `Set` called `usedIndexes`not shows the same quote .
